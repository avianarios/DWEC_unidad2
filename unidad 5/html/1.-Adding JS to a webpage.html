How to insert JavaScript code into an HTML file? by using <script> tag

How does it work?
    -when browser finds a script tag, it stops rendering HTML and starts downloading and executing code
    -scripts are executed in the order they appear in the HTML code

Where to place the script tag? 
    -at head. the script is downloaded and executed and after that, the html is rendered
    -at the end of the body. html is rendered and after that, the script is downloaded and executed

Three ways of inserting JavaScript code:
  1.- Embedding script code
  2.- Loading external resources from a CDN
  3.- Loading your own external JS file. Two ways of importing and exporting code:
        -Option 1: Load every js file in the same html file. Only recommended when code is not related.
        -Option 2: Organize the content into modules and import the main module. Only possible when code is related.

When loading external files, traditional blocking behaviour can be modified by using async and defer:
  -async: <script src="file1.js" async></script>
      -The rendering of the page is not blocked while the scripts are being loaded.
      -Scripts are executed as soon as they are loaded, so the order of execution is not guaranteed.
  -defer: <script src="file1.js" defer></script>
      -The rendering of the page is not blocked while the scripts are being loaded.
      -Scripts are executed in the order they are placed in the HTML code, but only after the entire page (DOM) has been parsed.

    Option 1: Not recommended. Embedded script into HTML code. It's better in a separate file-->
    <script>
      setTimeout(()=>{
        console.log("hola")
      }, 3000);
    </script>

    <!--Option 2: Loading external resources from a CDN (content delivery network). Be careful about what you charge, it could be dangerous

        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.21/lodash.min.js" integrity="sha512-wvHm8W2YdFx27tNwpYwOHKeglkIjG3CXMR1JLcEUQU9zI/hzP6UtWk4fNN0kfi32dT8Xq2a7rfFSJi5VpY2VwA==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" async></script>
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.29.4/moment.min.js" async></script>

      Option 3: Loading an own external JS file. 3 options:
        <script src="../js/1.-script.js"></script>  -> HTML rendering is blocked until the script is donwloaded and executed
        <script src="../js/1.-script.js" defer></script> -> script is loaded at background while HTML is being rendered and is executed only when HTML is rendered. Order is maintained
        <script src="../js/1.-script.js" async></script>  -> script is loaded at background while HTML is being rendered but it is executed as soon as it is available, blocking HTML rendering. Order is not maintained
