### Eventos en JavaScript
An **event** is an action or change that occurs on a web page or in the browser, either due to user interaction (such as a click) or by system processes (such as a page loading completely). We can associate actions with events such as:
    - The page finishes loading
    - The user clicks a button
    - The user hovers over a dropdown
    - The user submits a form
    - The user presses a key on their keyboard

#### Key concepts
- **Event handler:** A JavaScript function that executes when an event occurs.
- **Event listener:** An interface that ‘listens’ for a specific event on an element and executes the associated handler when it occurs.

#### Ways of handling events in JavaScript
Three ways of working with events:

1. **Inline event handlers (Manejadores en línea)**  
   *Not recommended.* Mixing HTML and JavaScript makes maintenance difficult and does not allow multiple handlers to be added for the same event.

   ```html
    <button onClick="console.log('¡Saludos, criatura!')">Saludar</button>
    <button id="enviar" onclick="saludar()">Enviar</button>
    <script>
        let saludar = () => console.log ("¡Saludos, criatura!");
    </script>

    <button id="enviar" onclick="saludar()">Enviar</button>
    <script src="codigo.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Event handler properties.** *Not recommended.* Some events can't be assigned by using properties and it only allows one handler per event
   ```javascript
    let boton = document.querySelector("#formulario_contacto button");
    boton.onclick = function () { console.log("¡Saludos, criatura!"); };

    let boton=document.querySelector("button");
    let saludar = () => console.log ("¡Saludos, criatura!");
    boton.setAttribute("onclick", "saludar");
   ```

3. **Using event listeners. *RECOMMENDED. It allows to attach more than one handler to the same event, it has control over when the event is triggered and it works even with no HTML elements
    ```javascript
    let boton=document.querySelector("#formulario_contacto button");
    boton.addEventListener("click", function (){        //it's click, not onclick
        console.log('¡Saludos, criatura!');
    });
    ```

### Common types of events:
    - Eventos de ratón:
        - click: When the user clicks on an element.
        - dblclick: When the user double clicks.
        - mouseover: When the mouse passes over an element.
        - mouseout: When the mouse leaves an element.
        - mousemove: When the mouse moves inside an element.
    - Keyboard events:
        - keydown: When the user presses a key.
        - keyup: When the user releases a key.
        - keypress (deprecated): Similar to keydown, but only for keys that generate characters.
    - Form events:
        - submit: When a form is submitted.
        - change: When the value of an input field changes.
        - input: Similar to change, but occurs while the user is typing.
        - focus: When an input field gains focus.
        - blur: When a field loses focus.
    - Document/window events:
        - DOMContentLoaded: When the DOM is fully loaded.
        - load: When all resources (images, scripts, etc.) are fully loaded.
        - resize: When the browser window is resized.
        - scroll: When the user scrolls the page.
