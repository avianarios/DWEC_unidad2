## 5 - Events
An **event** is an action or change that occurs on a web page or in the browser, either due to user interaction (such as a click) or by system processes (such as a page loading completely). We can associate actions with events such as:
    - The page finishes loading
    - The user clicks a button
    - The user hovers over a dropdown
    - The user submits a form
    - The user presses a key on their keyboard

### Key concepts
- **Event handler:** A JavaScript function that executes when an event occurs.
- **Event listener:** An interface that ‘listens’ for a specific event on an element and executes the associated handler when it occurs.

#### Ways of handling events in JavaScript
Three ways of working with events:

1. **Inline event handlers (Manejadores en línea)**  
   *Not recommended.* Mixing HTML and JavaScript makes maintenance difficult and does not allow multiple handlers to be added for the same event.

   ```html
    <button onClick="console.log('¡Saludos, criatura!')">Saludar</button>
    <button id="enviar" onclick="saludar()">Enviar</button>
    <script>
        let saludar = () => console.log ("¡Saludos, criatura!");
    </script>

    <button id="enviar" onclick="saludar()">Enviar</button>
    <script src="codigo.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Event handler properties.** *Not recommended.* Some events can't be assigned by using properties and it only allows one handler per event
   ```javascript
    let boton = document.querySelector("#formulario_contacto button");
    boton.onclick = function () { console.log("¡Saludos, criatura!"); };

    let boton=document.querySelector("button");
    let saludar = () => console.log ("¡Saludos, criatura!");
    boton.setAttribute("onclick", "saludar");
   ```

3. **Using event listeners. *RECOMMENDED. It allows to attach more than one handler to the same event, it has control over when the event is triggered and it works even with no HTML elements
    ```javascript
    let boton=document.querySelector("#formulario_contacto button");
    boton.addEventListener("click", function (){        //it's click, not onclick
        console.log('¡Saludos, criatura!');
    });
    ```

### Common types of events:
#### Mouse Events
- **click**: Fires when the left mouse button is clicked.
- **dblclick**: Fires when a double click is performed.
- **mousedown**: Fires when a mouse button is pressed.
- **mouseup**: Fires when a mouse button is released.
- **mousemove**: Fires when the mouse pointer moves within an element.
- **mouseover**: Fires when the mouse pointer enters an element (including child elements).
- **mouseout**: Fires when the mouse pointer leaves an element (including child elements).
- **mouseenter**: Similar to `mouseover`, but does not include child elements.
- **mouseleave**: Similar to `mouseout`, but does not include child elements.
- **contextmenu**: Fires when the right mouse button is clicked.

## Keyboard Events

- **keydown**: Fires when a key is pressed.
- **keyup**: Fires when a key is released.

## Input and Form Events

- **input**: Fires when the value of an input field (input or textarea) changes.
- **change**: Fires when the value of an input changes and is confirmed (e.g., when focus is lost or a selection is made in a dropdown).
- **focus**: Fires when a field gains focus.
- **blur**: Fires when a field loses focus.
- **submit**: Fires when a form is submitted.
- **reset**: Fires when a form is reset.

## Window and Document Events

- **load**: Fires when the page and all its resources have fully loaded.
- **DOMContentLoaded**: Fires when the DOM has been fully loaded, without waiting for external resources.
- **resize**: Fires when the browser window is resized.
- **scroll**: Fires when the page or a scrollable element is scrolled.
- **beforeunload**: Fires just before the page is unloaded (useful for warning users about unsaved changes).

## Touch Events

- **touchstart**: Fires when a touch starts.
- **touchmove**: Fires when a touch moves.
- **touchend**: Fires when a touch ends.
- **touchcancel**: Fires when a touch is canceled.

## Drag and Drop Events
