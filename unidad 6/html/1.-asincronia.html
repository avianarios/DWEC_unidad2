            <h2>Types of programming</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Synchronous programming: i+1th line is executed after the ith has finished its execution. Some lines/functions take a long time (they have to wait for external resources, perform a lot of operations or it is just inefficient code), blocking the execution of the page</li>
                <li>Asynchronous programming: i+1th line is executed no matter if ith line has finished its execution</li>
                </ol>
            <h2>Asynchronous programming</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A promise is an object returned by an asynchronous function that represents the current state of the operation</li>
                <li>A promise can be in three states
                    <ol>
                        <li>pending</li>
                        <li>fullfiled. The API has processed the request and it has replied. Even if it is a negative response (404 not found in fetch)</li>
                        <li>rejected. It provokes a call to catch handler</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML)?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>is a technique that allows retrieving specific parts from the server to update sections of a webpage without having to load an entire new page</li>
                <li>it saves a lot of bandwidth in data-oriented websites by avoiding server having to send again CSS, JS, HTML...</li>
                <li>In the past, it was used only with XML, but not anymore. It can be used with JSON, XML or text</li>
                <li>It was possible by using XMLHttpRequest API. Nowadays, fetch API is way more used. Therefore, AJAX is nothing else but performing asynchronous calls and upgrading just a part of the website rather than requesting the whole page</li>

            <h3>Chaining promises</h3>
            <p>When using the fetch() method to make a request to a server, a promise is got back resolving to a Response object. This object represents the entire HTTP response, including the status, headers, and body. However, the body is not directly accessible as a string or an object, but rather as a stream of data that can only be read once.</p>
            <p>To handle the response body, it is needed to use one of the methods of the Response object that returns another promise that resolves to the parsed data. These methods are: json, text, blob, arrayBuffer and formData</p>

            <p>Promises can be chained if the output of one is to be processed by the next one</p>
