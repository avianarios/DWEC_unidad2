// Exercises on Objects in JavaScript

// Exercise 1: Create an object with properties that describe a car (brand, model, year).
// Exercise 2: Create a constructor function for a Person and instantiate two objects from it.
// Exercise 3: Access properties of a book object using both dot notation and bracket notation.
// Exercise 4: Modify the year published property of the book object.
// Exercise 5: Add a new property (color) to the car object.
// Exercise 6: Remove the model property from the car object.
// Exercise 7: Create an object and freeze it. Try to change one of its properties.
// Exercise 8: Create an object and prevent it from having new properties added. Try to add a new property.
// Exercise 9: Use Object.keys() to get the keys of a student object and print them.
// Exercise 10: Use Object.values() to get the values of a student object and print them.
// Exercise 11: Iterate through the properties of a pet object and print each property with its value.
// Exercise 12: Write a function that checks if two objects have at least one property in common.
// Exercise 13: Create a function that returns a new object that merges two given objects.
// Exercise 14: Create a function that clones a given object.
// Exercise 15: Create a function that compares two objects and returns true if they are equal, false otherwise.
// Exercise 16: Write a function that destructures an object and returns its properties as variables.
// Exercise 17: Create an object that uses 'this' in a method and show how to call it correctly.

/*Extra 1:
Having the following object, write a function that gets the total amount of kg that the fruit shop has. Create two pieces of code solving the problem. In one of them, Object.values must appear and in the other one, for...of must be present. Prepare the function for the case that there is no fruit at all

let frutas={
    "manzanas golden": 25,
    "manzanas fuji": 20,
    "pera conferencia": 17,
    "pera ercolina": 12
}
*/

/*Extra 2:
 Take the Extra 1 exercise and write a function that returns an object containing the name of the fruit (including all varieties) and the total number of kgs
