//Destructuring

//Exercise 1: Create a function that receives an object with the properties name and age, and uses destructuring to return a string that says "Hello, my name is [name] and I am [age] years old."

//Exercise 2: Create an object representing a book with properties like title, author, and year. Use destructuring to print each of these properties to the console.

//Exercise 3: Create a function that receives an array of objects (each object representing a person with properties name and age) and uses destructuring to return a new array that contains only the names.

//Exercise 4: Given a nested object that contains information about a city (name, population, country), use destructuring to access the country property and display it in the console.

//Advanced Usage of this

//Exercise 5: Create an object representing a car with a method showDetails that uses this to access its properties brand and model. Then, create a function that calls this method and demonstrates the correct use of this.

//Exercise 6: Define an arrow function inside a method of an object that tries to access this and shows what happens. Then, fix the problem using a traditional function.

//Exercise 7: Create an object representing a counter with methods to increment and show the value. Ensure that this works correctly in both methods.

//Exercise 8: Create a user object with a present method. Then, call this method from another context (outside the object) using call or apply to demonstrate how the context of this can be changed.

//Optional Chaining

//Exercise 9: Create a nested object that represents a student with properties name and course. Use optional chaining to access a property that may not exist (e.g., student.course.name) and display a message in the console if the property exists.

//Exercise 10: Define an object representing a person with optional properties. Use optional chaining to access properties that may not be defined and return a default value if they do not exist.

//Exercise 11: Create an object that contains information about a company and use optional chaining to access the company's address, displaying a message in the console if the address is not defined.

//Exercise 12: Define an object representing a book with a review property that can be null. Use optional chaining to display the review in the console only if it exists.

//Getters and Setters

//Exercise 13: Create an object representing an employee with properties name and salary. Define a getter for salary that returns the salary in currency format and a setter that validates if the salary is a positive number.

//Exercise 14: Define an object representing a circle with a radius property. Create a getter that calculates and returns the area of the circle and a setter that validates the value of the radius.

//Exercise 15: Create an object representing a student with properties name and grades. Define a getter that returns the average grade and a setter that adds a new grade.

//Exercise 16: Define an object representing a product with properties name, price, and discount. Create a getter that returns the final price after the discount and a setter that validates that the price and discount are positive.

//Prototypical Inheritance and Method Overriding

//Exercise 17: Create an object animal with a method makeSound. Then, create a dog object that inherits from animal and overrides the makeSound method to return "Woof".

//Exercise 18: Define a vehicle object with a type property and an info method. Create a motorcycle object that inherits from vehicle and overrides the info method to include specific information about the motorcycle.

//Exercise 19: Create a base person object with properties name and age. Then, create a teacher object that inherits from person and adds a subject property, overriding the method that presents the information.

//Exercise 20: Define a book object with a description method. Then, create a novel object that inherits from book and overrides the description method to include additional information specific to a novel.
