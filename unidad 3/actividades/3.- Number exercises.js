//1. Creation and Conversion of Numbers

    //Exercise 1: Create a variable num1 as a primitive number and a variable num2 as a Number object with the same value. Compare their values using == and ===. What do you observe?

    //Exercise 2: Convert a string that represents a decimal number (e.g., "12.34") into a number. Print the result.

    //Exercise 3: Convert a string that contains a hexadecimal number (e.g., "0x1A") into a number. Print the result.

//2. Value Verification

    //Exercise 4: Check if several values are finite. Test with the following: Infinity, NaN, 100, -200, 0.

    //Exercise 5: Check if several values are NaN. Test with the following: NaN, 0/0, undefined, Number("foo").

    //Exercise 6: Convert several strings into integers. Test with the following: "42", "42.5", "0x1F", and "not a number".

    //Exercise 7: Convert several strings into floating-point numbers. Test with the following: "42.5", "0.1", and "3.14abc".

//3. Comparison and Precision

    //Exercise 8: Compare the results of 0.1 + 0.2 and 0.3 using a comparison with tolerance. Print true or false depending on the result.

    //Exercise 9: Create a function called areNumbersEqual(a, b) that compares two numbers to determine if they are practically equal. Test the function with various pairs of numbers.

//4. Method Usage

    //Exercise 10: Create a Number object and convert its value to a string in different bases (2, 8, 10, 16). Print the results.

    //Exercise 11: Create a Number object and obtain its primitive value. Print the result.

//5. Floating Point Numbers and Representation

    //Exercise 12: Print the maximum and minimum values that can be represented in the Number object. Explain what they represent.

    //Exercise 13: Print the value of NaN and check if it is a number. What is the result?

//6. Application Exercises

    //Exercise 14: Write a function called convertToBinary(num) that receives a number and returns its binary representation as a string.

    //Exercise 15: Write a function called sumNumbers(a, b) that takes two numbers, sums them, and returns the result. Ensure to correctly handle cases where the numbers are decimal.
