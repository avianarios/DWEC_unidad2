//1.-JavaScript Precision
/* Exercise 1.- In JavaScript, 0.1 + 0.2 does not result in exactly 0.3 due to floating-point precision issues. Compare the results of 0.1 + 0.2 and 0.3 using a comparison with tolerance. Print true or false depending on the result.

//2.-Creating a Number Object
/* Exercise 2.- Create a Number object from the following values:
    - An integer.
    - A decimal number.
    - A string containing a valid number.*/
//Exercise 3: Create a Number object and obtain its primitive value. Print the result.
//Exercise 4.- Use the Number constructor to attempt creating an object with invalid values, such as "Hello", undefined, and null.

//3.-Getting the Value of a Number Object
// Exercise 5.- Create a Number object with the value 42. Use the appropriate method to get its primitive value and verify its type.

// 4.- Comparison
//Exercise 6: Create a variable num1 as a primitive number and a variable num2 as a Number object with the same value. Compare their values using == and ===. What do you observe?

//5.- Checking if a Number is Finite
/* Exercise 7.- Write a function that takes a number as a parameter and checks if it is finite or infinite. Test the function with the following values:
    - 42
    - Infinity
    - -Infinity
    - NaN*/

//6.- Checking for NaN
/* Exercise 8.- Create a function that determines if a value is NaN. Test it with:
    - The result of 0 / 0.
    - The result of 42 / "Hello".
    - A valid number.*/

//7.- Checking if a Number is an Integer
/* Exercise 9.- Write a function that takes a number and returns true if it is an integer or false otherwise. Test it with the following values:
    - 3
    - 3.14
    - -42
    - NaN*/

// 8. Conversion to String
/* Exercise 10.- Convert the following numbers to strings using different methods and analyze the results:
    - 42
    - 3.14159
    - Infinity
    - NaN
//Exercise 11: Create a Number object and convert its value to a string in different bases (2, 8, 10, 16).
