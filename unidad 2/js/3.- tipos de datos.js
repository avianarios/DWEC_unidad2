/*Primitive data types:
    -Number: Integer or floating point. Special values: Infinity, -Infinity, NaN (not a number). erroneous operations can be done and JavaScript will never stop (you will get NaN)
    -BigInt: Allows to represent integers larger than (2^53)-1. Is created by appending a “n” at the end of an integer number
    -String: Chain of symbols (letters, numers, special symbols), treated as one. Must be surrounded by double, simple quotes or inverted quote (backticks). Double or simple quotes are the same. Backticks are extended functionality, allowing to embed variables or expresions by wrapping them in ${var}
    -Boolean: Logic value that can be true or false
    -null: Developer has to specify this value when creating a variable. It means it has no valid value
    -undefined: Variable has been created but with no value
    
non-primitive data types: Object, Array, Function, Date, RegExp

Primitive data types are inmutable. They can't be changed after being created. Any operation that involves changing its value, is creating a new element

Non-primitive data types are mutable. Their value can be changed while the objects remains the same*/
